# Human Pose Estimation Starter Kit
{: .fs-9 }

A PyTorch-based starter kit for 2D human pose estimation projects, designed for researchers working on optimizing human pose estimation networks using knowledge distillation and neural architecture search. It provides an interface for training, inference, and evaluation, as well as the dataloaders for common human pose estimation datasets.
